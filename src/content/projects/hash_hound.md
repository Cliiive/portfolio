HashHound is a fast, automated forensic image scanner that recursively analyzes disk images, computes file hashes, and compares them against a database of known hashes. It helps investigators quickly identify known files and trace digital evidence. You can checkout the source code on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Cliiive/HashHound).
