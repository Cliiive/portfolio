Whistledrop is a secure whistleblower system that enables encrypted communication between whistleblowers and journalists through the Tor network with end-to-end encryption using asymmetric RSA encryption. It's inspired by the [Securedrop](https://securedrop.org/) project. You can checkout the source code [here](https://github.com/Cliiive/whistledrop).
